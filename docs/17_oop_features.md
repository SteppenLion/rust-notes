# Object-Oriented Programming Features of Rust

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of modeling programs. Objects as a programmatic concept were introduced in the programming language Simula in the 1960s. Those objects influenced Alan Kayâ€™s programming architecture in which objects pass messages to each other. To describe this architecture, he coined the term object-oriented programming in 1967.
