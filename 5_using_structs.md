# Using Structs to Structure Releated Data

- _struct_ or _structure_ is custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up meaningful group.

## Defining and Instantiating Structs

- Structs are similar to tuples, they hold multiple related values.
- Defining struct:

```rust
struct User {
  active: bool,
  username: String,
  email: String,
  sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
  let user1 = User {
      email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
      username: String::from("someusername123"),
      active: true,
      sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

- to get specific value from the a struct we use dot notation. If the instance is mutable we can change a value by using fot notation into a particular field

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}
```

- NOTE: entire instance must be mutable; Rust does not allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable.

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}
```

## Using the Field Init Shorthand

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email, // shorthand
        username, // shorthand
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}
```

## Creating Instance From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax

- it useful to create a new instance of a struct that includes most of the values from another instance, but change some. -> _struct update syntax_

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
}
```

- The `..user1` must come last to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the corresponding fields in `user1`, but we can choose to specify values for as many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in the structâ€™s definition.

## Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types

- Rust support structs that look similar to tuples, called _tuple structs_
- they don't have the names associated with their fields, just they have the types of the fields
- useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple from other tuples

```rust
struct Color(i32,i32,i32);
struct Point(i32,i32,i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0,0,0);
    let origin = Point(0,0,0);
}
```

## Unit-like Structs Without Any Fields

- we can also define structs that don't have any fields -> called _unit-like structs_
- Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don't have any data that you want to store in the type itself

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main(){
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```

## Method Syntax

- _Methods_ are similar to functions -> declare them with `fn` keyword and name.
- they can have parameters and return value and they have some code that's run when the method is called from somewhere else.
- unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of `struct` (or `enum` or `trait` object)
- their first parameter is always `self` which reperesents of the strust the method is being called on

### Defining methods

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("The area of the rectangle is: {}", rect1.area());
}
```
