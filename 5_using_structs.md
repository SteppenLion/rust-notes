# Using Structs to Structure Releated Data

- _struct_ or _structure_ is custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up meaningful group.

## Defining and Instantiating Structs

- Structs are similar to tuples, they hold multiple related values.
- Defining struct:

```rust
struct User {
  active: bool,
  username: String,
  email: String,
  sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
  let user1 = User {
      email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
      username: String::from("someusername123"),
      active: true,
      sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

- to get specific value from the a struct we use dot notation. If the instance is mutable we can change a value by using fot notation into a particular field

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}
```

- NOTE: entire instance must be mutable; Rust does not allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable.

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}
```

## Using the Field Init Shorthand

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email, // shorthand
        username, // shorthand
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}

```
