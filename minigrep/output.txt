Serching for to
In file poem.txt
People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'
You used to laugh about
About having to be scrounging your next meal
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?
A complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ah you never turned around to see the frowns
You never understood that it ain't no good
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
After he took from you everything he could steal
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
You used to be so amused
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
